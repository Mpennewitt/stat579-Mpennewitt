## creating first report for stats 579

Monica Pennewitt

In the past month I have been travelling, conducting field research and preparing for the new semester. 

My data collection is from a field trial, where I will be using population densities to determine efficacy. 
I haven't really started analyzing data yet, but I would say R is the best tool that I have.
